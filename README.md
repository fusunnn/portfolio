# Ivan Audouard;s Portfolio

## This is my portfolio that is being built with React TS, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS and framer-motion.

To modify and make it your own you can start by cloning it:

```
git clone https://github.com/fusunnn/portfolio.git
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

NOTE: To keep using the Email JS service that is used in the contact form (see: src/components/ContactModal.tsx), you will need to create a .env file in the base directory and create variables corresponding to the ones in the sendForm function (head to https://www.emailjs.com to get started).

Please contact me if you run into any issues.
